It was started and is maintained by a community of contributors. The project is collaborative, with contributions from many individuals and support from various organizations. \\n\\nHowever, some key figures have played significant roles in its development and in the development of `papermill` specifically:\\n\\n- **Matthias Bussonnier** is one of the notable contributors to the Jupyter ecosystem and has been involved with `nteract` projects. While not a founder in the traditional sense, his contributions to the broader Jupyter and interactive computing community are significant.\\n- **Kyle Kelley** is another prominent figure in the `nteract` community, contributing to various aspects of the project and its tools.\\n- **Safia Abdalla** is also a key contributor to `nteract` and has been involved in the development and advocacy of open-source tools for interactive computing.\\n\\nIt's important to note that `nteract` and `papermill` are community-driven projects. This means that they rely on the contributions of many individuals, including developers, data scientists, and enthusiasts in the open-source community. The success and development of these projects are attributed to the collective effort of the community rather than to individual founders.\", finished=False, has_displayed=True)"
